# Cloudmesh Cloud AI Service

The cloudmesh Cloud Ai service will provide AI capabilities that are running on the different cloud, e.g. chamelon, asure. For the example functions, linear regression, principle components analysis and so on will be provided so that users can utilize the computing power of the clouds to train their models. The cloudmesh cloud AI service will administrate  multiple clouds and determine which cloud to use for scheduled tasks.

## Architecture Design

![architecture](./report-firgures/architecture.svg)

The architecture primarily contains four objects:

* User which is the actor
* The application running on local host using cloudmesh  will manipulate multiple cloud instance, decides delegate computational tasks to which cloud
* The AI services will be running on the Asure, Chameleon, and Chameleon cloud, exposing APIs to incoming requests, and return the return the result to the local host


## Technical Analysis

### Operating System
* Mac OS
* Vitural Box: Ubuntu 19.04

### Database

* Mongodb

### REST

* OpenAPI: The REST API will be defined by using OpenAPI specification 
* Swagger editor: The swagger editor is used to write API documentation based on the OpenAPI standard 
* Flask: The web application framework that handles incoming requests
* Connexion: Connexion is an application on the top of Flask that will map the REST API documentation to python functions
on Flask
* Pytest will be the testing framework

* [Yanting Wan](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa19-516-151/graphs/contributors)
* Gregor von Laszewski, as modifications were substential, he also already set up cloudmesh-analytics, where this code will be migrated to.

## Progress 

### Week 6

[Qiwei Liu](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa19-516-151/graphs/contributors)

1. Set up flask web application framework
2. Set up the test framework and testing data based using sqlite3
3. Done file upload, list file
4. Set up chameleon instance

[Yanting Wan](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa19-516-151/graphs/contributors)

1. Set up connexion, and uses it to map Opean API(yaml) file.
2. Done uploading file locally, testing it on Swagger-ui
3. Done testing a ai function with locally stored dictionary as parameter, testing it on Swagger-ui

### Week 7

[Qiwei Liu](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa19-516-151/graphs/contributors)

1. Update folder structure
2. Gregor update folder structure, refactor file routes, refacter to analytics route

### Week 8 

1. Migration to cloudmesh-analytics <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-analytics>

[Yanting Wan](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa19-516-151/graphs/contributors)

1. Download a virtual box to run Ubuntu 19.04 system.
2. Reinstall cloudmesh-cloud, mongoDB in Ubuntu 19.04.
3. Start a VM in Chameleon.
4. Create venv and install requirements in migrated project folder.

- [ ] Problem1: cannot ssh into VM

### Week 9
[Yanting Wan](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-analytics/graphs/contributors)

1. Write pytest scripts that test the result of kmeans

When writing pytest scripts, come across "Module Not Found Error", to debug, start a new repository 
[yanting-516-partial-project](https://github.com/YantingWan/yanting-516-partial-project/graphs/contributors).

The reasons that cause "Module Not Found Error":
The "cloudmesh" directory in project has namespace conflict with "cloudmesh" directory in cloudmesh-cloud. Solution:
Run command "pip install ." or "python setup.py install". Then use command "python -m pytest" to run pytest.

### Week 10
[Yanting Wan](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-analytics/graphs/contributors)

1. Install Docker, run a simple REST service in container
([yanting-516-partial-project](https://github.com/YantingWan/yanting-516-partial-project/graphs/contributors))
2. Use cms command to start server in background(from cloudmesh.common.run.background import run)
3. Use cms command to make post/get request (python requests module)
4. Use sphinx-apidoc to generate documentation.

Use docker without typing sudo
```sh
# add docker group
$ sudo group add docker
# add user to docker group
$ sudo gpasswd -a myusername docker
# restart docker
$ sudo service docker restart
$ exit
```

### Week 11
[Yanting Wan](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-analytics/graphs/contributors)

1. Generate yaml file automatically:
    1. Use post/get decorator to read docstring inside endpoint functions, based on the docstring, output
    corresponding yaml file.
    2. Use jinja module, write a template file, based on the template file, generating corresponding endpoint 
    functions and yaml file.
2. Add code to 
[yanting-516-partial-project](https://github.com/YantingWan/yanting-516-partial-project/graphs/contributors) 
to use functions in cloudmesh-cloud, then containerlize the project that requires cloudmesh-cloud.


### Code Explanation



## Work Breakdown

## Example Usages

1. Upload a file to the server that will be further processed

```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/cloudmesh-ai-services/upload" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@learn.rkt"
```



2. Checking the uploaded files

```sh
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/cloudmesh-ai-services/list-files" -H "accept: application/json"
```



3. Contracting a json file which contains the file name, and the parameters for the linear regression to the REST API. The output will be save on the server that could be downloaded.

```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/cloudmesh-ai-services/linear-regression/linear" -H "accept: */*" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"file_name\":\"string\",\"fit_intercept\":true,\"n_jobs\":0,\"normalize\":true}"
```



The next version will encapsulate the server request command and user can only provide the content body, For exampleï¼Œ

```sh
cloudmesh ai upload "linear_regression.csv"
```
